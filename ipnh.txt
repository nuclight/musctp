      IPnh: Internet Protocol's Next Hop / Network Hierarchy
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The muSCTP protocol is mostly agnostic to underlying network layer
   protocol, so this, assuming muSCTP is significantly deployed, allows
   for changing to another IP version, not only IPv4 or IPv6 - something very
   hard to do on traditional TCP/UDP which essentially hardcode suport if
   either of two present versions.

1. Introduction.

TBD incorporate Section 1 of https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-omar-ipv10-12.txt

   There is still need for newer version of IP protocol - IPv6 is not
   satisfactory. IPv6 problems are real and remain real, see for example
   Huawei's NewIP initiative.

   IPv6, being a classic example of second-system effect (see F. Brooks'
   "The Mythical Man-Month" book), in fact is an epic fail. On the time line
   where entire Internet issued a new version if ubiquitous protocol, deployed
   it and then disabled interoperation with old unsupporting clients, this
   happened e.g. 4 times for SSL/TLS - but for the same quarter of century
   IPv6 has failed to be deployed as just only one main version.

   IPv6 has almost no benefits, just flaws. In fact, the only benefits are:

   * easy autoconfiguration in some cases
   * larger address space.

   And the latter is in fact not benefit, as *EVERY* successor of IPv4 had to
   have larger address space, IPv6 was just one candidate at IPng contest.

   The biggest problem of IPv6 remains backwards compatibility - old IPv4 with
   unmodified software cannot *transparently* speak to IPv6 hosts (NAT64
   finally appearedm, but too late and solving just half of two directions).

   The next big problem of IPv6 is Internet-of-Things (IoT) and mobile hosts.
   Ironically, larger address space was intended just for these myriads of
   devices, and yet it failed in practice - because of 1) fragmentation and 2)
   larger header. See how - the quote from RFC 4944: 

   | The MTU size for IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 is 1280 octets.
   | However, a full IPv6 packet does not fit in an IEEE 802.15.4 frame.
   | 802.15.4 protocol data units have different sizes depending on how
   | much overhead is present [ieee802.15.4].  Starting from a maximum
   | physical layer packet size of 127 octets (aMaxPHYPacketSize) and a
   | maximum frame overhead of 25 (aMaxFrameOverhead), the resultant
   | maximum frame size at the media access control layer is 102 octets.
   | Link-layer security imposes further overhead, which in the maximum
   | case (21 octets of overhead in the AES-CCM-128 case, versus 9 and 13
   | for AES-CCM-32 and AES-CCM-64, respectively) leaves only 81 octets
   | available.  This is obviously far below the minimum IPv6 packet size
   | of 1280 octets, and in keeping with Section 5 of the IPv6
   | specification [RFC2460], a fragmention and reassembly adaptation
   | layer must be provided at the layer below IP.  Such a layer is
   | defined below in Section 5.
   |
   | Furthermore, since the IPv6 header is 40 octets long, this leaves
   | only 41 octets for upper-layer protocols, like UDP.  The latter uses
   | 8 octets in the header which leaves only 33 octets for application
   | data.  Additionally, as pointed out above, there is a need for a
   | fragmentation and reassembly layer, which will use even more octets.

   So, 6LoWPAN defines an ugly set of crutches for IPv6 on it - not surprising
   that ZigBee (on same 802.15.4) is more successful.

   And IPv6 is very bad at fragmentation - gateway to constrained segment
   cannot just fragment packet, as it must behave like DF bit is always set...
   Moreover, as NDN Fragmentation Memo states, de-facto bad fragmentation
   support leads to "ossification" of IP packet size to common 1500 byte MTU,
   while for future high-speed links it may be desirable to raise MTU for both
   performance reasons and sequence number space limits shifting from byte
   numbers to packet numbers.

   Mobility is also not achieved - see https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170810 for
   long discussion of mobility evolution, and that IPv6 Host Mobility suffers
   from fundamental problem: latency, because of tunneling. The proposal on
   that page for UUID-like sockets is somewhat too radical, however - while
   muSCTP uses the same principle in Connection Tag, this could require
   replacing all transport protocols to muSCTP instead of gradual transition.
   So supporting older protocols by splitting single long identifier to host
   part and L4 part may still be reasonable.

   There are also other IPv6 problems, https://netch.livejournal.com/8262.html
   may give some other examples. Amongst them, e.g. chain of header reduces
   performance - one cannot just multiply second nibble like in IPv4 to get
   payload offset - multiple cache line loads may be needed to traverse the
   chain. Ironically, again, there were IPng proposals with variable address
   length, which were ditched with "fixed length is faster to parse"...

   Interestingly, that wasn't the first time of variable-length address idea:
   TCP/IP version 3 [IEN-21] in 1978 already proposed addresses 1 to 15 bytes
   length - which, if adopted, could save us all from NATs and IPv6 in the
   first place...

   So let's say final "NO!" to all opponents of variable-length addresses:
   for Internet to be really mix of *different* networks this is a must.
   Hardware producers blaming for performance must justify earning their
   salary, that's their problem, not of all others. Moreover, hardware evolves
   over the time more rapidly then protocols, so making assumptions about
   hardware capabilities at the time of protocol designing is not far-sighted.

   IPnh borrows ideas from Huawei's NewIP and IPng proposals which were
   alternatives to IPv6: IPv7 [RFC 1475] and Pip [RFC 1621][RFC 1622]. It's
   not surprising why Pip losed the contest to simpler proposals like SIPP:
   Pip as-is is really too complex to implement, with all of it's routing
   chains and even special servers for formatting Pip headers (violating
   end-to-end Internet principle, is now considered bad). However, it has
   many actual things, most notable mobility ID and same subscriber's part
   under different porviders in hierarchy.

2. Concepts and header.

   Conceptually, IPnh tries to go radical: what if, for greatest extensibility
   possible, we represent packet as JSON ? This would eliminate need for
   newer IP versions for many decades, if not centuries! And possibility to
   support non-host addressing modes, e.g. [Named data networking]...

   Of course, this contradicts effective machine processing. And there are
   at least two conflicting areas of machine processing already:
   high-performance systems and constrained systems (like aforementioned
   802.15.4). Thus, IPnh copes with it by having different forms for same
   data.

TBD 20.10.24 Van Jacobson's network channels:
<<One of the basic ideas behind AF_XDP dates back to Van Jacobson’s talk about network channels. It is about creating a Lock-free channel directly from driver RX-queue into an (AF_XDP) socket.
[...]
The transport signature that Van Jacobson talked about, are replaced by the
XDP/eBPF program choosing which AF_XDP socket to XDP_REDIRECT into.>>
- This refers http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/vj/lca06vj.pdf slide 26:
<<socket “registers” transport signature with driver on “accept()”. Gets back a channel.>>
...so - what if in the future computer will like HPC cluster today? so kernel
is just a router, and a hierarchical address is for everything, no TCP/UDP
ports!
BTW, in muSCTP `ServInstNum` is (independent) idea of something similar to
those independent sockets in Van Jacobson's talk.
<<It is, he says, simply the end-to-end principle in action yet again. This principle, which says that all of the intelligence in the network belongs at the ends of the connections, doesn't stop at the kernel. It should continue, pushing as much work as possible out of the core kernel and toward the actual applications.>>

2.1. Overview of packet and main concepts.

   IPnh packet has the following general structure:

      +=====================================+
      |                    |  Fixed Part    |
      |   Initial Header   +----------------+
      |                    |  Variable Part |
      +=====================================+
      | Fragment Descriptor / Balancer Part |
      +=====================================+
      |                                     |
      |             Options Part            |
      |                                     |
      +=====================================+
      |                                     |
      |                                     |
      |               Payload               |
      |                                     |
      |                                     |
      +=====================================+

   As fragmentation is an important part of IPnh, there is special part in
   packet if it is fragmented. To solve most of fragmentation problems
   described in [RFC 8900], author has found that it is enough to repeat first
   payload bytes in every fragment instead of putting them in just first
   fragment only. This is the place where middleboxes like e.g. firewalls and
   load balancers will look for them like if were beginning of payload, so
   it's also called "balancer part" on a figure above.

2.1.1. Host ID: fragmentation and mobility.

   Unlike Pip, where addresses were something second-class and used just for
   routing and first-class citizens were IDs, IPnh reverses this: due to need
   for compatibility with legacy addressing schemes, main focus is still
   on addresses. However, Host IDs - Source ID and Destination ID - remain an
   integral part of IPnh. Fragmentation, load balancing and host mobility all
   deal with Host IDs instead of addresses, like them would be primary
   identificators for hosts. Moreover, pseudoheader for TCP, UDP and other
   upper-layer protocols consists of Host IDs, so neither checksum
   recalculation will be needed when mobile host changes it's address, nor
   firewalls / load balancers need to lose their state.

   It is tempting to take EUI-64 as natural identifier for Host to be globally
   unique for mobility. However, one of IPv6 design flaws was exactly this:
   take MAC address as part of IPv6 and have privacy / tracking problems.

   So security lesson has been learned, and now Host ID is either:

   * explicitly selected by host and present in packet, or
   * absent in packet and calculated as hash sum from address.

   Note that transit routers do not need to calculate these hashes, just as
   they don't need to look into payload, even if such a router fragments
   packet, so performance here is not affected. Only end hosts and
   refragmenting instances like firewalls or load balancers need to - however,
   fast hash function do not add much for ability to seriously reduce latency
   for mobile hosts, so this is good trade-off.

TODO IPv6 mobility is triangular in best case - fundamental latency proble

TBD comparison with HIP (Host Identity Protocol), RFC 4423
and with LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol), RFC 6830

TBD draft-herbert-intarea-ila-01 : anycast, SIR prefix, ILA domain

2.1.2. Addresses: hierarchy, compatibility, extensibility.

   One of the IPnh goals is not only simplify address space and routing
   management by hierarchies, but also provide a "natural" way for presenting
   addresses of different types (become really *inter*-net again), including
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in such manner that hosts with such addresses and
   IPnh hosts can communicate without need dual-stack (triple-stack, etc.)
   support in each host, that is, without modification of hosts' software
   (except may be easy little parts like DNS resolver).

TBD which variant to take for compatible v4/6 ? tag 52/54/260 to string?
top-level in hier?

top-level: mb 4. for IPv4, 6 for IPv6, 11..17 for telephone codes like +7... ?

- variant: shortcuts for 4 one-byte elements and 8 two-byte elements
  so 4.200.200.200.200 for IPv4 and 34.200.200.200.200 generic both could
  take 6 bytes; same for MAC / EUI-64 ?


a file system metaphor
  /usr/share
  /usr/src
  /builder01/src/
  /builder02/src/

Host id as st_dev + inode?
- 20.10.24 or opaque is more simple/secure? and don't require management of IDs
  - st_dev may be used in routing protocols - where one subscriber "mounted"
    to multiple providers

with LDAP, there is no more file and directory distinction, also ReiserFS

TBD LDAP has multi-valued RDN, should we generalize it?
- seems not, "," is enough, other is not simple to implement

. as 0, .. as 1 and ../.. as 2 ?
**/ for anycast?
- 20.10.24 or anycast can be "symlink", invisible to sender
  - however response "here is neares to you" may be more efficient
    - but may be policy-disabled due to security concerns

it is tempting to mix layers having addresses of sockets, but Lindy Effect
- but see 20.10.24 of Van Jacobson... at least port compatibility for
  transition period?
  - 22.10.24 what if BGP load balancing of *outgoing* traffic is used by e.g.
    source ports? then having it at end of address will require non-contiguous
    masks if existing radix trie algorithms are utilized... so better to view
    different OSI layers as different dimensions?..
    - but is such poor traffic engineering method a justify to prohibit?..
  - 25.10.24 if do, then Host IDs are naturally generalized to Umbrella IDs:
    host, cluster, department, organization...
    - however, currently it's impractical as only Host could be mobile
      (reconnect on different hierarchy subtrees) - but who knows if in the
      future organizations also can easily get new providers connections
      "on the fly" ?

HIP says about mixing two layers, address and identity, but itself ironically mixes identifier with crypto key

    ^
TBD | 25.10.24 ~22:00 a ThSC point in a roaming from Home node is conceptually
    v   same situation as an IP host moving from 3G to WiFi link without
        connection interruption so Host IDs are here; however, differences are:
	1) Host ID ~= SSH key - is for for one online device of several, here,
	   it's like Anycast for online packets
	2) for mail/offline data, it's like a Multicast now

Pip:
===
   Thus, the basic form of a Pip address is:

         providerPart,subscriberPart

   where both the providerPart and subscriberPart can have multiple
   layers of hierarchy internally.

   A subscriber may be attached to multiple providers.  In this case, a
   host can end up with multiple Pip Addresses by virtue of having
   multiple providerParts:

         providerPart1,subscriberPart
         providerPart2,subscriberPart
         providerPart3,subscriberPart
...
   For instance, if two neighbor routers have Pip Addresses 1.2.3,4 and
   1.2.8,9.14 respectively, then they share levels 0 and 1, and are
   different at levels below that.  (0 is the highest level, 1 is the
   next highest, and so on.) As a general rule, these two routers
   exchange level 0, level 1, and level 2 routing information, but not
   level 3 or lower routing information.  In other words, both routers

   In this case, 1.2.8,9.14 does not need to know about level 2 or level
   1 areas in the provider (that is, it does not need to know about
   1.2.4..., 1.2.5..., or 1.3..., 1.4..., and so on).  Thus, 1.2.8,9.14
   should be configured to inform 1.2.3,4 that it does not need level 1
   or 2 information.
===
TBD 21.10.24 do we need "," in *packet* address encoding at all? filesystem
metaphor allows for host to send to "../../dest/server", making it natural for
IoT-constrained networks having short addresses, and let's routers to deal
with who is mounted to who at absolute addresses, not complicating address
encoding with CBOR tags. So there will be just a few special numbers for ".."
and "*" and may be "+" or "#" from MQTT, need more thinking here - but no more
wasting a bit or entire byte just for "," tag.
- "../style" is good for IoT, but it is essentially one-hop: router later in
  chain will probably have another prefix so ".." will become invalid if
  packet is not rewritten. May be better to have 3'rd element as common prefix
  for address compression? Or series of routing instructions with DNS-like
  label compression? However, such source-routing instructions also require
  a pointer "where we currently are at", which again is not very performant.
  Still, in a snail-mail/courier metaphor it is possible to not include
  country and town if delivery is in the same town - so inside one corporation
  or IoT PAN-network should be possible also, modulo fact subscriberPart may
  be connected via several global prefixes, like "in same mounted filesystem".
  Need to look closer to Pip and RFC1475 in more detail...
- 22.10.24 metaphor: address is like street, ID is like First Name Last Name
  on envelope - could be registered in this house, could be not; having
  memcmp()-comparable addresses - utilize existing radix tries just rounded
  to 8 bits instead of as in CIDR

TBD 25.10.24 05:09 it should be done the way when it simply is not possible to
spoof source IP address, thus flooding DDoS-attacks will die in the past
- 29.10 if this is path in tree (addrs combined), then how to force router to
  check incoming packet is not of spoofed path segment? In current Internet,
  reverse lookup is not done for performance reasons but this also allows
  mobile hosts (triangle); here, we can have Host IDs for mobile, but how to
  force, still? OK, it can't be full path that verified (e.g. rogue routers),
  but at least at first lawful router (so traceable entry point of spoofed
  flood) - how to make it that without path element validity check the whole
  system will simply not work?..

TBD renumbering problem: if one company has 10,12.3.4 and other has 10,12.4.1
then on merge acquisition they'll have overlapping addresses (problem in
current IPv4/IPv6 with even possible need for internal NAT); in Pip this is
not problem while hosts talk inside their own net with relative addresses, but
when to other? So need mechanism for all hosts to seamlessly be configured
like "change our prefix from 10,12.3 to 10.192.12.3" - as it is similar in
spirit mobile hosts, should be doable, but need to think details (and this is
thus a MUST to have relative addressing as in above paragraphs)


===
RFC 3649:
   In order for best-effort flows to safely start-up faster than slow-
   start, e.g., in future high-bandwidth networks, we believe that it
   would be necessary for the flow to have explicit feedback from the
   routers along the path.  There are a number of proposals for this,
   ranging from a minimal proposal for an IP option that allows TCP SYN
   packets to collect information from routers along the path about the
   allowed initial sending rate [J02], to proposals with more power that
   require more fine-tuned and continuous feedback from routers.  These

   | This is a significant advantage, that given the Internet
   | address no additional information is needed for an
   | implementation to determine if two addresses are on the same
   | subnet.

2.2. Common parts of all headers.

   All IPnh header formats have first two bytes in common:

    0                   1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...
   |Version|  IHL  | HCver |Frg|ECN|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...

  Version:  4 bits

    The Version field indicates the format of the internet header.
    For this draft, let the version be 8 (may be changed by IANA later).

  IHL:  4 bits

    Initial Header Length, in units depending on HCver.

  HCver:  4 bits

    This is not a minor version, but a Header Compression scheme combined with
    scheme version (cf. 6LoWPAN's HC1, HC2, IPHC, NHC...). All variants of
    HCver are still the same IPnh version header and consist of conceptually
    the same data, but represented in different forms. For example, a gateway
    between "big" Internet and constrained segment can statelessly transform
    packet from one header format from another.

    This drafts currently defines HCver 0 and 1.

  Frg:  2 bits

    Whether Fragment Descriptor is present or unfragmented, and fragment type:

    00 - unfragmented datagram
    01 - first fragment
    10 - last fragment
    11 - "middle" (neither first nor last) fragment

    Note that this is in fact bits B(egin) and E(nd) inverted to make simple
    test for presence of Fragment Descriptor by checking field to be non-zero.
    Every Header Compression scheme MAY define different Fragment Descriptor
    formats for these 3 combinations.

TODO 18.09.24 redo for "0 unfragged, other fragged but exact depend on HCver"

  ECN:  2 bits

    Explicit Congestion Notification bits, placed at the same place and having
    the same meaning as in IPv4 header.

TBD RFC 4782 "Quick-Start for TCP and IP" - what if integrate this in every
packet into unchecksummed "On-Path modify" word instead of ECN? together with
MTU; however, long nonces and other abuse/lying preventing measures are
required...
   The Performance Transparency Protocol (PTP) includes a proposal for a
   single PTP packet that would collect information from routers along
   the path from the sender to the receiver [W00].
   ETEN:
   Additional proposals for end nodes to collect explicit information
   from routers include one variant of Explicit Transport Error
   Notification (ETEN), which includes a cumulative mechanism to notify
   endpoints of aggregate congestion statistics along the path [KAPS02].
   (A second variant in [KSEPA04] does not depend on cumulative
   congestion statistics from the network.)
-- and other listed in Appendix A there are interesting
- 22.10 also checksum for very short:

Multiplexing Protocol                                             IEN-90
Introduction

The  demultiplexing   routine  should  be  able  to  handle  recursively
multiplexed  messages.   This is  to  allow  higher  level  protocol  to
demultiplex  their own messages  if they can be combined.   Since such a
multiplexed  message  may be  multiplexed  again  by  the  IN  level,  a
multi-level multiplexing results.

This protocol  assumes  that  the  Internet  Protocol  is  used  as  the
underlying protocol.

                  0      7 8     15 16            31

                       Multiplexing Header Format
Fields

CS is a checksum  covering  only this 32 bit multiplexing header.  Until
further notice, it is the exclusive OR of the other three octets in this
header.

TBD

2.2.1. Coloring word.

   In some header variants a "coloring word" (like "green traffic" or
   "red traffic") could be placed.

   This word is usually last and optional, it is present only if IHL is large
   enough AND that space is not consumed by addresses, IDs and short options.
   If it is not present, it MUST considered as containing all-zeroes. Meaning
   of fields is the same as Flow Label and Traffic Class in IPv6, except that
   it's "Traffic Class" expanded to 12 bits and divided into two fields: one
   coloring for technical needs (6 bits of traditional DSCP) and one (new)
   field for non-technical (legal) coloring.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    DSCP   |R|L/GovMark|           Flow Label                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

  Traffic Class and Flow Label:  6 bits.

    Traffic Class does not contain ECN and reserved bits are meant for aid in
    load balancing also, e.g. it may be expanded to full 12 bits instead of
    just 6 bits of current DSCP.

TBD 22.10.24 given RFC 1621 Section 7, put Ver here, and for zero ver ECN with
DSCP/Label as for compatibility with current IPv4/IPv6 ?

  R:  1 bit

    Reserved for future use, MUST be 0 on send and ignored on receipt.

  GovMark:  6 bits.

    Government or Local Policy Mark is meant as a compromise between
    conflicting legal and moral requirements. While Internet always was been
    for global connectivity and against censorship, and that was supported by
    using cryptographic means to prevent e.g. tampering of the packet, there are
    still valid cases when middleboxes could do something to packets instead of
    dropping (philosophically like ECN field added instead of dropping) to let
    end-system (or near-end system) to decide. Most notable example of this is
    "adult content" where for many people it is normal but parents may want to
    enable filtering which may be infeasible to do (on the Internet scale) on
    end children's device. In case of government-level censoprship, using
    cryptography and other hiding tools usually leaves the only choice for
    censors to block traffic completely, an "all-or-nothing", because e.g.
    HTTPS do not allow them to add "COURT DECIDED THIS IS FAKE NEWS SITE"
    Big Banner or something like that to web page. We believe that adding such
    outside-of-content markers could reduce level of censorship blocks in the
    world.

    A big enterprise network could also make benefit on simplification access
    rules by marking traffic by e.g. access levels, thus this field could also
    be used not only Government but as Local Policy Mark, too. This is in
    spirit of early days of IP when some bits of TOS field where for
    confidentiality level.

    This draft do not specify values to this field except that zero (0) MUST
    mean absence of any legal/policy mark, and decimal 24 is RECOMMENDED for
    "adult" traffic (so that with default traffic class 0x018 on the wire could
    be easily identified as not for children under 18 years).

  Flow Label:  20 bits.

    Same as in IPv6.

2.3. Optimized for performance header: HCver=0.

   This is variant of header intended to be most common, in "normal"
   Internet - 0 as "Old" / "Optimized" for performance. It can be seen that
   some fields are at the same place as in IPv4 header, with same meaning.

   Here, length unit, word, is defined as 32 bits.

  IHL:  4 bits

    Initial Header Length is in 32-bit words, like IPv4, but to obtain actual
    length, 2 is added. That is, maximum length of header is 68 bytes, and IHL
    value MUST NOT be zero or one - these reserved for future use.

  Flags and Reserved:  8 bits
===
      o The GUE header includes a header length field. This allows a
        network node to inspect an encapsulated packet without needing
        to parse the full encapsulation header.

      o The flags-field model facilitates efficient implementation of
        extensibility in hardware.

        For instance a TCAM can be use to parse a known set of N flags
        where the number of entries in the TCAM is 2^N.

        By comparison, the number of TCAM entries needed to parse a set
        of N arbitrarily ordered TLVS is approximately e*N!.
===
TBD "Options Present" bitmap is also in PIP - combine somehow

    TBD

  NHL:  2 bits

    Length of Next Hop field in 32 bit words. May be 0 for absence of Next Hop
    field, the most common expected case, or 1 or 2, for 32-bit of 64-bit
    Next Hop. Value 3 is currently reserved and MUST NOT be used (it's not
    decided yet to be 3 words or 2^2 words).

TODO 18.09.24 move this length outside of other lengths: as it is essentially
like VLAN tag or MPLS label, it will be used by intra-AS routers in links with
larger MTU when end host may already filled up other available space with
addresses/options; also CW for coloring word as also addition to length
- TBD 23.10.24 https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-bryant-arch-fwd-layer-ps-05.html
  says that many length are not enough (esp. MPLS), so let's increase it!
  - TBD 03.11.24 or put into IHL real offset to some part e.g. end of
    identifiers? better for entire header to have 1-byte-described length,
    even better to fit into one mbuf

  DIL and SIL: 3 bits each

    Destination Host ID length and Source Host ID length, in words. Actually,
    not all values are for length - some say that there is no corresponding ID
    in packet, and this is number of hash algo to calculate it:

    0 - no ID in packet, hash algorithm 0
    1 - no ID in packet, hash algorithm 1
    2 - no ID in packet, hash algorithm 2
    3 - no ID in packet, hash algorithm 3
    4 - no ID in packet, hash algorithm 4
    5 - Reserved
    6 - Host ID present, 2 words (64 bits)
    7 - Reserved

    It is not yet decided will 5 be for hash 5 or 32-bit ID, and whether 7 be
    for 3 or 4 words.

TBD short option in "every frag options" for overriding hash algo / key / nonce?

TBD 03.11.24 put MTU into On-Path field when gets fragmented by router

  CWL:  2 bits

    Length of balancer/L4 helper part which is not related to fragmentation.
    Currently only 0 and 1 defined, with 1 meaning - Coloring Word present.

  Flags:  3 bits

    TBD

  Options Length:  8 bits

    Length of options, in 32-bit words. Thus, options may have length from
    0 to 1020 bytes.

  DAL and SAL:  4 bits each

    Destination and Source addresses length, in elements.

TBD 18.09.24 may be 1..17 bytes? enough for "tag+IPv6" Aug2024 TBDs in 2.3.1
- this means minimum address length is 2 bytes

  Total Length:  16 bits

    Length of this IP datagram in bytes, as in IPv4.

  Hop Limit (TTL), Protocol, Header Checksum

    See IPv4. Differences are that Checksum does not cover TTL (as in IPv6)
    and does not cover Options Part with big options - there are special
    option there, as in DCCP, for their checksum and probably part of payload.

    Header Checksum, however, covers more than IHL words - there are also
    Coloring Word, Fragment Descriptor and Copy of L4 payload beginning, if
    fragment. That is, up to 2 + IHL + NHL + CW + (Frg ? 1+FrL : TODO) words
    (96 bytes max).

  Coloring word:  last 32 bits.

    For Traffic Class and Flow Label, optional, see section on coloring word.

  Next Hop / Forward Route Identifier:  absent, 4 or 8 bytes

    This optional field, if present, contains information to be interpreted by
    next router *instead* of Destination Address, and possibly other
    variable-length fields/options (at the discretion of that router). Thus,
    if present, it is first in packet at fixed offset, facilitating
    forwarding plane performance. It is intended to be used like described in
    Section 3.4 of [RFC 1475], MPLS-like or instead of MPLS.

    This specification does not constrain how this field to be implemented,
    but possible suggestions could include even offset of routing entry in FIB
    memory region, along with some error checking bits.

    Note that, despite of name, this value is not restricted to be hop-by-hop
    or changed at every hop, so chain of routers in area from entry to exit
    could all use single value in this field, making variable-length
    addressing not slower, but even faster than traditional CIDR.

2.3.1. Addresses.

   For compactness, common CBOR types are optimized into custom format.

- 27.08.24 as only 23 bits is used in Ethernet, and not all blocks are
  assigned, this familiarity requirement is no longer of a priority, at least
  less important than single-byte addresses capacity

TBD what if make lengths external, as in SQLite row header, so SAL/DAL is
number of nibbles, each descirbing number of bytes?
- may be useful for constrained (IoT) format (HCver=1), but too complex for
  performance one, e.g. in common task "reverse source and destination";
  also constrained may utilize hextet-compressed from early BPF64
- in fact, the primary representation, at conceptual level, is CBOR, even if
  particular optimized implementation will never do CBOR - so we don't need
  arbitrary formats here, like integers up to 128 bits for boths IPv6 and MAC
  addresses. Let's just do short forms for exact CBOR constructs, like
  "tagged string with IPv6 address" (and some codes reserved for extension)

=== http://www.employees.org/~ravir/cbor-network.txt :
IPv4 Address is stored as 4 bytes.
IPv6 Address is stored as 16 bytes.
MAC  Address is stored as 6 bytes.

Tag value of 260 is used to mark that the following byte string data
is either a IPv4 address or IPv6 address or MAC address (depending on
the length). The addresses are stored in binary values in the network byte order.

Examples:
d9 0104 44 c00a0a01     --> IPv4 address 192.10.10.1
d9 0104 46 0123456789ab --> MAC address 01:23:45:67:89:ab
d9 0104 50 20010db885a3000000008a2e03707334 --> IPv6 address 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334
===
TBD for F4..FB choice depends on how address space will be designed for
interoperability with IPv4 and IPv6... from CBOR and compactness PoV, tags
are better, but for end nodes, it's better to have just one stack
implementation with connects to addrs like .4.1.2.3.4 for IPv4 1.2.3.4 or to
.6:2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334 for IPv6 (leading dot or colon selects
decimal or hexadecimal in human representation)
- they still will have to implement it in DNS (at least A and AAAA), so may be
  provide tagged versions as "shortcut form" ? with rules like "it must be
  last element of address"


2.3.2. Fragment Descriptor.

   In case packet is fragmented, FrL defines length of Fragment Descriptor of
   the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   /   Copy of first fragment payload's first 0, 1, or 2 words     /
   \                                                               \

   |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

TODO put FrL somewhere in fixed part TBD or maybe MF here and
     Frg=unfrag/first/nonfirst-1-word/nonfirsr-2-word in fixed part

TBD unit is 4 byte word, so reduce Flags to 2 bit / move to fixed?

TBD move Ident word first and/or combine with Coloring Word so that packet
    start is simply calculated by adding bits to IHL?

TBD 18.09.24 using FrL=1 can't be indicator "first fragment, next bytes are
payload start" because large Options part may also be present; DF must also be
in main header because it may be unfragmented datagram with no descriptor to
look for flags - and also there must be preferred copy size (1 or 2 words) if
fragmentation is allowed (DF=0... so ternary?)
- problem: length ternary here, ternary there... may be fix length to 1 word?
  as L4 ports usually 4 bytes, later variable fields
  - no, SCTP also have 8 bytes, and muSCTP tunnels probably should be fixed
    moving ConnectionTag to first 4 bytes changing TSL to Ver/Init
-> so Frg and FrL:
   * FrL as "DF or preferred copy length or, if Frg>0, actual copy length"
   * Frg: unfrag, nonfirst frag, first without copy (payload reachable), and
     first with copy e.g. too long Options Part which is also fragmented
   * for first frag, 16 bits of total length after reassembly
   * for later frags, MF, Resereved bit and Fragment Offset

TODO

2.4. CBOR Header: HCver=0xC.

   This is almost full "everything in CBOR" version, except of fields which
   can't be expressed in CBOR - e.g. length, checksum and fragmenting of CBOR
   itself. Unfortunately, this means that fragmentation must be Hop-by-Hop,
   as in NDN: that is, fragments don't travel network but are reassembled by
   each next hop, and each hop refragments packet when forwarding it to next
   link (given that's link MTU). While this scheme certainly has benefits as
   described in [NDN-FRAG], it also has drawbacks. Thus, an attempt was made
   to put a little more non-CBOR fields - that is, use Next Hop from
   traditional format to make it possible for reasembly/refragmening on just
   some (presumable border) routers, not all of them. This also means presence
   of Traffic Class / Flow Label for them, where, again, Flow Label is a part
   of fragment identifier.
